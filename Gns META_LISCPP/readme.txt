	GNS :: META_LISCPP is a template metaprogramming library that tries to
	wrap a lisp like syntax over C++ templates.

	In short it can be said that GNS::META_LISCPP is an open source library
	based sub language built over C++ to make template meta programming easier 
	and more readable by using a LISP like syntax.
	
	No runtime entities have been used in the entire library.
	
	Feel free to read the source code to understand the usage.
	I will try to provide proper documentation as soon as possible.
